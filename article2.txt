Misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate has denied that he has cancer after confirming last week that he has a 'dark spot on his lung'.

In the latest update to his millions of Twitter followers, Tate's account said the scar on his lung 'is from an old battle' after the medical details were released last week.

The former kickboxer is currently being held in Romania alongside his brother Tristan on suspicion of organised crime and human trafficking, which they deny. 

'I do not have cancer. My lungs contain precisely 0 smoking damage. In fact, I have an 8L lung capacity and the vital signs of an Olympic athlete,' the update said.

'There is nothing but a scar on my lung from an old battle. True warriors are scarred both inside and out,' the post added in a style that has become typical of Tate's social media messages since his detention.

Last week, Tate's team told MailOnline that he had attended a medical consultation with doctors in Dubai about his 'serious' health condition that must 'not be taken lightly' before he was arrested in December.

Since his arrest, Tate has been receiving medical treatment in Romania for the medical condition - and the influencer remains 'strong' and 'in good shape' - his representative said on Friday.

Tate's doctors, in both Romania and Dubai, reportedly wrote in medical documents that the influencer has a lesion of his upper right lung - a condition that has been described as a 'serious health condition'. His doctor said the lesion could be a sign of a carinoid tumour - a rare type of slow-growing cancer.

Tate initially confirmed the major health fears, with his spokesman telling MailOnline: 'Tate has a dark spot on his lung, most likely a tumour.' 

As a result, his doctors have requested that Tate, who has been held at a Romanian prison since late December on sex trafficking charges, be released from prison so he can receive treatment in Dubai.

But on Monday morning, Tate's Twitter account moved to quell the questions around his health. His message to his five million followers came alongside a picture of a shirtless Tate striking a pose in a gym, which his left leg stretched out to his side.

Romanian officials have said Tate will receive any medical treatment in Romania. 

Monday's somewhat bizarre post continued in typical Tate fashion.

'As one of the most influential men on the face of the planet It is important for the good of humanity that I live as long as possible,' it said.

'At my current strength levels, I estimate to survive for at least 5000 more years. With this in mind, I take my medical care extremely seriously.

'I had a regular checkup organized in Dubai pre-detention. The doctors were extremely interested in the scar on my lung.

'They do not understand how I survive without treatment. They do not know the secrets of Wudan. But this battle has long passed.'

The post also shared a link to a page on Tate's website titled 'Tales Of Wudan' in which he spins a fictional story about how he lived 5000 'human years' on top of a mountain. 'I remember every lived second,' the page says.

The story is accompanied by a series of pictures in the style of Japanese art, depicting a cartoon Tate undertaking 'trials' and doing martial arts.

Tate's lawyers have previously said he does not have access to social media while being held in Romania, suggesting someone else is posting to Twitter on his behalf.

Earlier this week, the Tate brothers lost their latest bid to be released from jail, with a Romanian court upholding a third extension for their detention.

The divisive influencer will now be detained for another 30 days - until at least March 29, according to Ramona Bolla, a spokesman for Romanian anti-organised crime agency DIICOT - as the investigation continues.

Bolla said prosecutors also won an appeal on Monday against a court's decision last week to place under house arrest two women also held in the case, instead of in full detention. None of the four under investigation have been formally charged.

The appeal was the third the brothers have lost against decisions to extend their detention while investigations continue.

A document explaining an earlier decision to keep them in jail said the judge took into account the 'particular dangerousness of the defendants' and their capacity to identify victims 'with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities'.

Tate, who has lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech.

He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence and alleged their case is a 'political' conspiracy designed to silence him.

DIICOT said in a statement after their arrests in December that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were subjected to 'acts of physical violence and mental coercion' and were sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group. 

The agency said victims were lured with pretences of love and later intimidated, put under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for the financial gain of the crime group. 

Since their arrest, the brothers have allegedly demanded prison officers bring them a PlayStation and a hair stylist, reports Romanian news site Gandul But the pair have been snubbed by officials who have refused their demands.
